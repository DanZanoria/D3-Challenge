# D3 - Challenge



## Primary Goal: 
### Create a Chart that would compare Poverty Rate and Health Care. And Have appropriate Labels

## Bonus Challenge
### Create an interactive circle chart that would cycle between [Poverty & Healtchare], [Age & Smoke], and [Income & Obesity] 

## Disclaimer: 
### Due to the complexity of this assignment. It was suggested by the ones guiding my in SlackBot to restart from scratch. The page that is called bonus.html was the original that I working but most of the code was not working.

### After redoing the code. And have a working 1 circle chart. I decided to play with the original code a bit. Using the knowledge i gained from starting over. However, I could not figure out figure out how to replicate the code that have the labels inside the circlee. So i decided to bring both codes in the the assignment.
### Having the labels in the circles is appropriately given credit in app.js after the ones guiding me in slackbot suggested for me to take a look into it and see if i can apply it into my code.

#### index.html is connect to app.js
#### bonus.html is connected app1.js

### The Index will only have [Poverty & Healtchare], but with labels inside the circle values.
### The bonus will have the interactive chart but the labels will not be inside the circle. It will on be the top left corner
