# D3 - Challenge



## Primary Goal: 
### Create a Chart that would compare Poverty Rate and Health Care. And Have appropriate Labels

## Bonus Challenge
### Create an interactive circle chart that would cycle between [Poverty & Healtchare], [Age & Smoke], and [Income & Obesity] 

## Disclaimer: 
### Due to the complexity of this assignment. It was suggested by the ones guiding my in SlackBot to restart from scratch. The page that is called bonus.html was the original that I working but most of the code was not working.
### After redoing the code. And have a working 1 circle chart. I decided to play with the original code a bit. Using the knowledge i gained from starting over. However, I could not figure out figure out how to put the circle labels in the code. So instead of having 1 page that is incomplete, i decided to show both work.

###  The Bonus and Index have two different codes. 
### The Index will only have [Poverty & Healtchare], but with labels showing their values.
### The bonus will have the interactive chart but no labels showing each label.
